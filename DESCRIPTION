Title: Simulate a fishery (age, length and weight of individual fish).
Description: Functions for reading sale notes data and parameter estimates from a fitted ECA model,
     and thereafter simulating a fishery: simulate age, length given age and weigth given length.
     Sale notes data is a dataobject with one line per landing and the columns:
     Boat, S, G, R, Weight, L, Boat2, LwiB  (Boat: orig. boat number, S: season, G: gear,
     R: region (ECA-region 1:9), Weight: total weight in landing (converted to gram),
     L: landing, Boat2: boat number within (S,G,R), LwiB: landing number within boat).
     Output is a simulated fishery (a list object, with elements Boat, S,  G, R,
     Weight, L,  Boat2, LwiB,  ExpectedWeight, Nofish, ages,  LGA (length given age),
